# EPL_Data
This project is just for fun! Combining our love of statistics/data and football!

All data is publicly available through http://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php

All the individual season data sets are upload as .csv files.

The merged (master) EPL file will also be available as a .csv file upon completion.


## Questions we would like to answer
1. Does changing manager improve performance / increase the likelihood of survival?
2. During a season, does momentum matter in terms of results?
3. Can we use unsupervised learning techniques (Nagin clustering) to determine which teams are on the up and which on the down? (for eg: Arsenal :D)
4. How much does home advantage matter?
