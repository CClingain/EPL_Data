# Transfer Data 

Goal: we want to be able to cluster player's club trajectories to understand the patterns and paths they take. Do English players only seem to stay in England? Do Brazilian players make their way to Spain via England and Italy?

Transfer data that is available mainly centers on the fees. Therefore, we will be scraping data from various places of the web to construct our data set.
